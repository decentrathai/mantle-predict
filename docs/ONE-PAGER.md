# MantlePredict - One Pager

## Problem

Traditional prediction markets are:
- **Expensive**: High gas fees on L1 networks make small bets impractical
- **Limited scope**: Mostly focused on crypto-native events
- **Complex**: Order books and liquidity requirements deter casual users
- **Lacking RWA focus**: No dedicated platform for real-world asset predictions

## Solution

**MantlePredict** brings prediction markets to Real World Assets with:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Low fees | ~$0.01 per transaction on Mantle L2 |
| RWA focus | Bonds, commodities, real estate, macro events |
| Simple UX | Buy Yes/No shares, claim winnings |
| AMM pricing | No order books, instant liquidity |
| Oracle support | Automated resolution via price feeds |

## How It Works

```
1. Browse Markets    →  View active predictions on RWA events
2. Buy Shares        →  Purchase Yes or No shares with MNT
3. Price Discovery   →  Prices reflect collective market sentiment
4. Resolution        →  Oracle or resolver determines outcome
5. Claim Winnings    →  Winners receive proportional payout
```
